    <p>Hello there. My name is Taylor Baldwin, and Iâ€™m a software engineer at Torando Labs. Before joining the wild world of start ups, I worked in R&D at the New York Times. And before that, I was a pianist pursuing a doctorate in music. So there's that.</p>
    <p>These days I spend my free time dabbling in open-source and working on experimental projects - most of which can be found on my <a href="//github.com/rolyatmax">GitHub</a>.</p>
