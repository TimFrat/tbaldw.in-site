tbaldw.in-site
=========

This is (most of) the code for [tbaldw.in](http://tbaldw.in).

Make sure you run `cd app && npm install`. Also: `gem install compass`.

Then, run a server from the `app` directory: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000`, and point your browser to `localhost:5000`.

For development, just run `node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js watch` from the `app` directory.
